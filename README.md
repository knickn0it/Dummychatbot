You can add relevant information to your `README.md` to explain your project, how to set it up, and how to use it. Here's a sample `README.md` template you can modify to fit your chatbot project:

## Requirements

### Backend:
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Hugging Face `transformers` library

### Frontend:
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Dependencies:
- Install the necessary Python dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setting Up

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/simple_chatbot.git
```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd simple_chatbot
```

3. Set up a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On **Windows**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

6. Add your **Hugging Face API Token** to a `.env` file (do not commit this file):
   
   Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory and add the following line:

   ```plaintext
   HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=your_hugging_face_api_token_here
   ```

## Running the Project

### Backend (Flask):
1. Navigate to the `backend/` directory and run the Flask app:

```bash
python app.py
```

2. The server will start running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### Frontend:
1. Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser.
2. The chatbot interface should be displayed, and you can interact with the chatbot.

## How the Chatbot Works

- The chatbot uses a pre-trained GPT-2 model from Hugging Face's `transformers` library.
- User input is sent to the backend (Flask app), which processes the text and generates a response from the model.
- The frontend sends AJAX requests to the backend to fetch chatbot responses in real-time.
